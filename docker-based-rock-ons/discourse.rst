Discourse Rock-on
=================

Please be aware of the common prerequisites for all Rockstor :ref:`rockons_intro`;
specifically the :ref:`rockons_preinstall` and :ref:`rockons_root`
requirement.

Our `Discourse Rock-on forum <https://forum.rockstor.com/t/discourse-rock-on/941>`_ area.

.. _discourse_whatis:

What is Discourse
-----------------

Discourse is open source forum / discussion server software and is what the
`Rockstor forum <https://forum.rockstor.com/>`_ itself uses; in fact Rockstor's
forum is in fact hosted as a Rock-on on a Rockstor system. It is available in
`17 languages and counting
<https://www.transifex.com/discourse/discourse-org/>`_ and supports such
features as `single sign on
<https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourseconnect-official-single-sign-on-for-discourse-sso/13045>`_
and real time notifications. The source code for Discourse is available on `the
Discourse GitHub Page <https://github.com/discourse/discourse>`_. Visit the
Discourse `online sandbox <https://try.discourse.org/>`_ for a demonstration.

.. _discourse_doc:

Discourse Documentation
-----------------------

Discourse's `About Page <https://www.discourse.org/about/>`_ is a good place to
start along with their `FAQ <https://www.discourse.org/about>`_ and their
`Blog <https://blog.discourse.org/>`_.

.. _discourse_install:

Installing Discourse Rock-on
----------------------------

First please consider the pre-requisites for any Rock-on; these are linked to
at the :ref:`top <discourse_rockon>` of this document. Note also that the
Discourse Rock-on will require a Share to store it's forum data.  Note that
this is in addition to the :ref:`rockons_root` that may well already have been
made.

.. _discourse_port:

Discourse Ports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the **Default Port** and it is unlikely you will have to alter it. The
port shown on your particular install may not be the same as in the following
image. Also note that you may have to forward this port on your network's
firewall to the Rockstor system to have internet access to Discourse.
