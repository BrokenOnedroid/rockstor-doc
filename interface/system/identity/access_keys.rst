Access keys
===========

Access Keys are authentication credentials that can be used to communicate with
a Rockstor appliance's API directly. They are similar to username and password
credentails used to login to the Web-UI, but are meant for applications to
program directly using the API.

In the above example, there are two keys. **cliapp** is generated by default
duing OS installation, whereas **newkey** is later created by me. A key has two
components, an *ID* and a *Secret*. Access keys are required for one Rockstor
appliance to communicate with another programatically. **cliapp** is also used
internally within a single appliance.
