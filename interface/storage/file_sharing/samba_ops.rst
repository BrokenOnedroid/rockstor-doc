Rockstor supports making Shares available to SMB and CIFS clients via Samba
software suite. Samba service must be turned on before exposing shares.

Create a Samba Export of a Share
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Web-UI, click on the *Storage* tab to enter the main Storage view. Now
click on *Samba* in the left sidebar to go to the *Samba* view.

Click on the *Add Samba Export* button. Fill in the form with the appropriate
values as explained below.

In the list of shares, select the shares that you want to export through Samba.

In the *Admin Users* field, enter a space separated list of usernames who will
have administrative access to this share. These users can be local, or from NIS
or Active Directory. *Admin Users* are equivalent to the *root* user on
Rockstor and have all permissions. If your users come from Active Directory, we
recommend you use one *Admin User* and add/change ACLs for other users from
a Windows machine.

Set *Browsable* to *yes* if you want clients to be able to see the exported
shares.

Set *Guest OK* to *yes* if you want to permit guest access.

Set *Read only* to *yes* if the share should not be writable by clients.

View Samba Export
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you already have Samba exports created, you can see them displayed in a
table.

All the details about the samba export are present in the table. Here is what
the columns in the table mean:

* Name of the share ->  Share which is exported.
* Browsable -> Is the Share browsable by everyone? yes/no
* Guest Ok -> Are Guests Ok to access the share? yes/no
* Read only -> Is the Share Read only?
* Admin Users -> Users who have administrative access to the Share.
* Comments -> Comments related to particular samba export.
* Actions -> To delete the Samba Export.

To disable Samba/CIFS access, go to the *Samba* view as before, and click on
the trash icon for the appropriate share to delete the Samba export for that
share.


How to Access a share
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From a Windows machine:
---------------------------

1. Go to the File explorer and in the location field, enter the ip address of
   your Rockstor appliance in the following format.

   which prompts for the username and password.

3. The domain name is defaulted to your machine name. Enter
   *DOMAINNAME\\username* in the username field to change the domain. Use
   WORKGROUP as the domainname if it is a local user, or use the AD domain if
   it is an AD user. (*username* is the username of the user who has
   permission to access the share)

4. Enter the user's password.

5. Check remember credentials, and click Ok

6. The File explorer will attempt to connect to the Rockstor appliance, and if
   successful, you will be able to see the shares available on Rockstor.
